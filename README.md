# Welcome to the Advanced Programing course (INT2215).
## Course objective
This module helps students build a programming mindset, how to build a program from an initial idea to a complete program, as well as introduce some advanced programming techniques. 
Students can build a complete program that interacts with the user to perform a specific task through programming techniques in high-level programming languages, e.g., C++. 
Students are able to modularize the program into relatively independent components and be able to perform unit testing, simple program debugging.

## What & How to do in this repository?
This repo provides functional templates of 07 game projects using C++, including:
* P1: Hello World
* P2: Guess It
* P3: Calculus
* P4: Hang Man
* P5: SimpleAI
* P6: Painter
* P7: Snake Game

You are required to implement 'empty' functions to make the games run properly. 
The completed program will be automatically tested with test cases via pull requests and Github Actions.

Keep calm and enjoy coding!
